# THARMAS Config

Contains a melange of configs for my home server.

## Schooner

Home media server setup, see [schooner/README.md](schooner/README.md) for more details. This was written to be fairly easy to adapt for other people's uses.

## Networking

Networking config for tharmas, kept separate from the media stuff for separation of concerns, although this will probably become annoying as time goes on, we'll see.
